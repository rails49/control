# Train Control

Dispatching trains on a model railroad: deadlock-free, high-throughput
allocation of track to scheduling requests. The app never touches hardware:
whatever drives the track implements the **layout interface** — reporting
sensor readings, executing turnout and throttle commands. A simulator
implements it first, a physical layout later.

## Language

### Layout

**Block**:
A section of track without turnouts where a train can park, oriented with ends
`A` and `B` and having a length.
_Avoid_: section, segment, track

**Terminal block**:
A block with only one connected end, derived from the connections rather than
declared. Can only be the start or end of a route, never intermediate.
_Avoid_: dead end. *Siding* is a physical description — a trailing dead-end
track, which is usually a terminal block — and stays available as such (Claro's
`claro_4`–`claro_7` are sidings). It is not a synonym for the model concept:
say "terminal block" when the one connected end is what matters.

**Connection**:
The junction joining one end of each of one or more blocks, realized by zero or
more turnouts. Declares its named transits and, **by inversion**, which pairs of
them are `concurrent`; every pair not declared conflicts
([ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-conflicts-declared-by-inversion.md)).
_Avoid_: connector, junction, node

**Transit**:
One traversable (end, end) pair through a connection, always named.
**Undirected** — one transit covers both directions of travel — and
**self-exclusive**, so head-on use is excluded structurally. Two transits at the
same connection may be in use simultaneously only if the connection declares
them `concurrent`.
_Avoid_: route (reserved for the request-level path), path, crossing

### Stock

**Train**:
A collection of locomotives and cars moving or parked as a unit; its length is
the sum of its parts. A train occupies exactly one block at a time.
_Avoid_: consist

### Dispatch

**Request**:
An order to deliver a train out through one end of its block and in through one
of a set of **arrival ends**. Rejected only if no arrival end survives — none
fits the train, or none is reachable; otherwise accepted and queued.
_Avoid_: order, job

**Arrival end**:
One acceptable ending for a request: a block together with the end the train
**enters through**, written `<block>.A` / `<block>.B` exactly as a departure end
is. A request names a *set* of them, unordered and equally acceptable, and the
dispatcher commits to one when it chooses the route
([ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-requests-name-a-set-of-arrival-ends.md)). Naming both
ends of one block says "either way round"; naming several blocks says "any of
these tracks".
_Avoid_: destination (the request has no single one), arrival side, platform

**Route**:
A train's full path for a request: an alternating sequence of blocks and
transits, fixed when the train starts moving. Strictly pass-through — a train
enters each block at one end and exits at the other; reversal happens only
between requests, at rest. Also a **simple path**: no block or transit occurs
twice. So a reversing loop turns a train over *two* requests, not one — not
because reversal is forbidden (the loop needs none) but because the second leg
would revisit the loop's own blocks.
_Avoid_: itinerary, journey, plan

**Lock**:
Exclusive claim on a block or transit by one train. Incremental locking claims
only the current and next resources of a route; full-route locking claims all
of them up front. Occupancy is a **standing lock**: every train, moving or
parked, requested or not, always holds the lock on the block it stands in.
_Avoid_: reservation, allocation

**Active / idle train**:
A train is **active** while it has a committed route — launched, not yet
completed — and **idle** otherwise, whether or not a request for it is pending.
An idle train's standing lock makes its block *permanently* unavailable, since
nothing in the dispatcher will move it; this is what
[SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) means by a permanent obstacle.
_Avoid_: running/stopped, busy/free

**Tick**:
The discrete time unit of the simulator: each tick, a moving train completes
one transit. Travel time within blocks is ignored. The dispatcher itself is
event-driven and never reads a clock.
_Avoid_: step, cycle
